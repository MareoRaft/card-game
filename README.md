## About

Object-Oriented approach.



## Installation

TLDR: **[Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2715/)** and [prompt_toolkit](https://pypi.org/project/prompt_toolkit/#files) are the only dependencies.

In detail...

While I personally prefer the newest version of Python, for this submission I have chosen Python 2.7 because it ships out-of-the-box with almost any laptop or desktop you could buy.

But if for some reason `python --version` does not output something like `Python 2.7.x`, you may need to download the appropriate installer at [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2715/) and run it.



## Usage

Simply run the `game.py` script.  For example:

    cd card-game-matthew-lancellotti
    ./game.py
