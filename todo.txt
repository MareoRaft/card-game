  * change 'suit' to 'suit value'
  * put error messages (face val, suit) into their own file
  * use the key= option in sort() function for cleaner sorting
  * have a descending_players function that returns the players in order of their score
  * list(reversed(sorted((p.score, p) for p in players)))
TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'Player' and 'Player' (should be solved by sort above)
  * maybe the same but for card too
  * get rid of the period after the cards
